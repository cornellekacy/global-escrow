<h5>Why Should you use escrow?</h5> <br>
<p>If you are a customer, and you pay before receiving the goods or services you can be scammed by the seller, especially when the seller is anonymous.</p>

<p>If you are a seller, sending merchendise or providing services to a customer before he pays can get you scammed, for example if the customer has no money.</p>

<h5>Payment Options</h5>
<br>
<p>Global Escrow Services accepts only bitcoin as a payment option because is harder to trace.</p>

<h5>Advantages of Using Global Escrow Services</h5>
<br>
<p>All other escrow services ask for identifiable information about customers and vendors. We do not. We accept full anonymity for our users .</p>

<p>All other escrow services ask for email addresses. We do not. Emails and phone numbers can be traced back to identifiable people. You need disposable email accounts or fake email accounts to avoid being discovered. Why wasting time to create fake email accounts, when the transaction can go without an email address.</p>

<p>All other escrow services do not accept illegal services. We do accept illegal services.</p>

The sale is highly simplified as you, the buyer, just pays off your price and let Global Escrow Services handle everything else, be it shipping, delivery or quality inspection.</p>

<p>Using a licensed escrow service to buy and sell merchandise, services and more is the most convenient way to complete transactions online. Facilitated by a trusted third-party, the escrow process acts as your tool to ensure a safe, secure and intuitive sale for both buyers and sellers.</p>


<h5>Fees</h5>
<br>
<p>Global Escrow Services chrges 01% of each transaction.
For example, a transaction worth $1000 has a fee of $10. If the customer pays the fee, he will pay $1010

If the buyer pays the fee, the customer will pay $1000, and the buyer gets $990.

Once the customer deposit the funds into escrow, we give the seller green light to deliver goods or services.

If there is a dispute, we work with buyer and seller to see which one tries to scam the other party.

It's very important that customer and seller write exact specification of the merchendise or service to be delivered.

For example, if you are purchasing stolen credit card information, and is not working, we can check wheter the delivered credit card information is working or not, and give the funds to the buyer or to the seller acordingly.

An escrow transaction can only work if we can check whether the customer received the merchendise or services.</p>
